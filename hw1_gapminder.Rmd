# Dataset Exploration

First of all, we need to load the dataset:

```{r}
library(gapminder)
```

Now, we can examine the **first** 6 rows of the dataset:

```{r}
head(gapminder)
```

As well as the **last** 6 rows:

```{r}
tail(gapminder)
```

We can also get summaries for a specific variable as in:

```{r}
# Disabling scientific notation
options(scipen = 999)
# Summary for Population
summary(gapminder$pop)
```

Finally, we can get side-by-side boxplots for Life Expectancy across all continents:

```{r}
boxplot(lifeExp ~ continent, data = gapminder, main = "Distribution of Life Expectancy across All Continents")
```

We can see important differences in medians and spread from one continent to another.
