### Reflections on the GitHub Workflow and R Markdown

I didn't have any problems in terms of the GitHub workflow and R Markdown. I was pretty curious in tasks 1 and 4. Task 1 presented particular results in terms of the maximum `gdpPercap` for certain years in Asia, which made me go beyond the superficial data visualization. That's how I got the countries that were responsible of this situation (oil-related ones). Task 4 presented some challenges in terms of new data visualization plot (stacked bar charts by `continent`). I learned how to implment new `ggplot2()` tools and techniques using the following sites:
- [`ggplot2()` help for bar charts.](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html)
- [R Graphics Cookbook - Chapter 3: Bar Graphs.](https://rpubs.com/escott8908/RGC_Ch3_Gar_Graphs)
- [`ggplot2()` help for modifying axis, legend, and plot labels.](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labs.html)
- [Cookbook for legends in `ggplot2`.](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Legends_(ggplot2)/)
