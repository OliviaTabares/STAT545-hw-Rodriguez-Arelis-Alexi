### Reflections on the GitHub Workflow and R Markdown

I didn't have any problems in terms of the GitHub workflow and R Markdown. Actually, I learned how to reorganize my existing repository with a new folder structure. In terms of the `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages, I found the official `R` help really useful, specially the one from the [`ggplot2` website.](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_abline.html). In general, almost all the plotting aesthetics were taken from my current research figures (simulation plots and stuff). However, the inclusion of vertical lines in different facets was something new to me.
